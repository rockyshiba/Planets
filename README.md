# Routing

The custom routing module, app-routing.module.ts, requires components in order for the router to navigate to their content. Notice also in this file that the defined routes are in an array of objects, each with a property to recognize a URL and what component to display. 

In views, navigating to these components requires anchor tags with the 'routerLink' attribute, the values of which correspond to routes defined in the router module.
